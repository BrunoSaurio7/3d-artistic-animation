# Geometric Animation 3D
This project is the second assignment for the Computer Graphics course. It transitions the abstract 2D animation developed in https://github.com/BrunoSaurio7/2d-artistic-animation
into a volumetric 3D environment, exploring spatial composition, physics, lighting, and interactivity

# Project Overview
The scene recreates the cubist style of Lebedev's Red Army and Navy Defend the Russian Borders using geometric primitives in Unity. The project demonstrates the implementation of:

- 3D Scene Composition: Translation of 2D shapes into 3D volumes
- Lighting Models: Use of Point Lights and Spot Lights to accentuate diffuse and specular reflections on materials
- Physics & Animation: Usage of Rigidbodies for gravity effects and script-based animation for character movement
- User Interaction: Real-time control of lighting and camera navigation
