# Geometric Animation 3D
This project is the second assignment for the Computer Graphics course. It transitions the abstract 2D animation developed in https://github.com/BrunoSaurio7/2d-artistic-animation
into a volumetric 3D environment, exploring spatial composition, physics, lighting, and interactivity

**By:**
- Bruno Daniel Pérez Vargas
- Fernando Villalobos Betancourt

## Project Overview
The scene recreates the cubist style of Lebedev's Red Army and Navy Defend the Russian Borders using geometric primitives in Unity. The project demonstrates the implementation of:

- 3D Scene Composition: Translation of 2D shapes into 3D volumes
- Lighting Models: Use of Point Lights and Spot Lights to accentuate diffuse and specular reflections on materials
- Physics & Animation: Usage of Rigidbodies for gravity effects and script-based animation for character movement
- User Interaction: Real-time control of lighting and camera navigation

## Controls
| Action | Input / Key | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Move Camera** | `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` | Fly through the scene (Forward, Left, Back, Right). |
| **Rotate Camera** | `Right Click` + `Mouse` | Look around the environment. |
| **Adjust Height** | `Q`, `E` | Move camera Down (`Q`) or Up (`E`). |
| **Move Point Light** | `Arrow Keys` | Controls the Omni-directional light position. |
| **Move Spot Light** | `Mouse Pointer` | Controls the overhead reflector light position. |
| **Quit** | `ESC` | Closes the application. |
